## 📌 Problem Statement
Intelligent Automation for a Smarter & Safer Future

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
SmartGuard AI is an AI-driven intelligent automation system designed to monitor real-time sensor data and automatically detect abnormal or unsafe conditions. The system reduces manual monitoring by continuously analyzing data and generating alerts when anomalies are detected.

Unlike traditional monitoring systems, SmartGuard AI performs automated decision-making by detecting anomalies in real time and raising alerts without human intervention.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach
The system simulates sensor data such as temperature and vibration, processes it using an anomaly detection engine, and exposes the results through a backend API. A simple web dashboard is used to visualize system status.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Flask (Backend API)  
- Rule-based AI anomaly detection  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)  
- Git & GitHub  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases
- Industrial machine health monitoring  
- Smart building safety systems  
- Infrastructure monitoring  
- Preventive maintenance and risk detection
